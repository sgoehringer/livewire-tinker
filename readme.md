# Tinkering with Livewire &amp; Laravel
This is just a playground to toy around with [Livewire](https://github.com/calebporzio/livewire), a magical front-end framework for [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) created by [@calebporzio](https://github.com/calebporzio)

## Goals
- Build some things
- Probably nothing too special
- See how it works
- Share with some friends

## Projects
- Counter (Essentially right from the docs)

## References
- [Livewire Documentation](https://livewire-framework.com/docs/quickstart/)
